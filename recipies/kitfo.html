            <h1>Steps</h1>
            <ol>
                <li>Cut the beef into thin slices, trim any fat and then mince into very small cubes, preferably by hand, or in a food processor. Set the beef aside, spreading it over a plate.</li>
                <li>Melt the kibbeh in a medium skillet over very low heat. Add the mitmita, korerima, koseret and salt and stir with the butter. Then, add the minced beef and mash to mix it with the spiced butter; keep mixing until the beef reaches your desired temperature, 3 to 5 minutes for rare. Serve with farmer's or cottage cheese, Gomen Kitfo and injera.</li>
